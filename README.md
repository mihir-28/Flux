# Flux

Flux is a web-based chat application that provides users with a simple, secure, and reliable platform to communicate with each other in real-time. With Flux, users can create an account, log in, and start chatting with other users without the need to download a separate application. The application's data is backed up, and passwords are encrypted using MD5 encryption, ensuring user data is secure.

The application's user interface is designed to be easy to use and navigate, providing a clutter-free and user-friendly experience. The project's scope is to develop a chat application that is reliable, secure, and able to handle large amounts of traffic. Additionally, the project aims to continuously improve and enhance the application by adding new features such as video calling and file sharing.

The ultimate goal of the project is to establish Flux as a strong competitor in the chat application market, providing users with a secure and user-friendly chat experience.
